# Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine
Collaborative Filtering is a method used by recommender systems to make predictions about an interest of an specific user by collecting taste or preferences information from many other users. The technique of Collaborative Filtering has the underlying assumption that if a user A has the same taste or opinion on an issue as the person B, A is more likely to have B’s opinion on a different issue. 

In this project I use a Restricted Boltzmann to predict whether a user would like a movie or not based on this user's taste and the taste of other users who watched and rated the same and similar movies.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.6
- TensorFlow 1.5 or higher
- NumPy 1.11 or higher

# Datasets

The current version support only the MovieLens ml-1m.zip dataset obtained from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.

# How to Use

- Download the ml-1m.zip dataset from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.

- Save ratings.dat under DATA_DIR. Devide the ratings.dat into training and testing datasets train.dat and test.dat with the shell command: 

         python train_test_split.py DATA_DIR OUTPUT_DIR_TRAIN OUTPUT_DIR_TEST

- Use shell to make TF_Record files out of the both train.dat and test.dat files by executing the command:
        
        python tf_record_writer.py OUTPUT_DIR_TRAIN OUTPUT_DIR_TEST OUTPUT_DIR_TF_TRAIN OUTPUT_DIR_TF_TEST

- Use shell to start the training by executing the command (optionally parse your hyperparameters):

        python train.py \
             --tf_records_train_path=OUTPUT_DIR_TF_TRAIN \
             --tf_records_test_path=OUTPUT_DIR_TF_TEST \
       
# Performance of the Model

During the training process we can examine the progress of the accuracy on training and test sets. The accuracy gives the ratio of correctly predicted binary movie ratings. It can be seen that after 16 epochs the model predicts 78,4% of the time correctly if a user would like a movie or not.
